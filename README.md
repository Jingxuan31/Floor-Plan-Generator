# Floor-Plan-Generator
When drawing architectural plans, designers
should always define every detail, so the images
can contain enough information to support a design.
This process usually costs much time in the
early design stage when the design boundary has
not been finally determined, thus the designers
spend a lot of time working forward and backward
drawing sketches for different site conditions.
Meanwhile, machine Learning, as a decision
making tool, has been widely used in many
fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is
a model frame in machine learning, specially designed
to learn and generate image data. So this
research aims to apply GAN in generating architectural
plan drawings, helping designers automatically
generate the predicted details of apartment
floor plans with given boundaries. Through
the machine learning of image pairs that show
the boundary and the details of plan drawings,
the learning program will build a model to learn
the connections between two given images, then
the evaluation program will generate architectural
drawings according to the inputted boundary
images. This automatic design tool can help
release the heavy load of architects in early design
stage, quickly providing a preview of design
solutions for architectural plans.
